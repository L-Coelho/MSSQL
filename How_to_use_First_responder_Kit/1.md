## Decoder ring for the 6 most common wait types

>
CXPACKET/cxconsumer: queries going parallel to read a lot of data or do a lot of CPU work.
Sort by CPU and by READS.

LCK%: locking, so look for long-running queries. Sort by DURATION, and look for
the warning of "Long Running, Low CPU." That's probably a query being blocked.

PAGEIOLATCH: reading data pages that aren't cached in RAM. Sort by READS.

RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE: queries can't get enough workspace memory to start running.
Sort by MEMORY GRANT, although that isn't available in older versions of SQL.

SOS_SCHEDULER_YIELD: CPU pressure, so sort by CPU.

WRITELOG: writing to the transaction log for delete/update/insert (DUI) work.
Sort by WRITES.
